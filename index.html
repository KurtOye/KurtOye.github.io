    <h3>Bootcamp 2021: Pong Game</h3>
    <p>
        For my first programming project, concluding the 2 week bootcamp at City, I made a simple pong game.
        This pong game features a ball that gains speed as it bounces against the walls, and a paddle that is meant to keep it in the sketch.
        In this game, I used many different features that are present in Processing. This ranges from: using PVectors to determine x,y and velocity. 
        Using class functions to seperate my code so that it is more readable.
        Using keyPressed and keyReleased to allow the user to move the paddle, and using the if statement excessively to create the bounce effect.
